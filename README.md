# zrm

`zrm` is a command-line tool written in Nim that enhances file and folder deletion by integrating with `fzf` (a command-line fuzzy finder). It provides a fast and interactive way to select multiple items for deletion.

## Features

-   **Interactive Deletion:** Uses `fzf` to create a fuzzy-searchable, interactive list of files and directories.
-   **Multiple Selections:** Select one or more items to delete using the `<TAB>` key.
-   **Safety First:**
    -   Requires confirmation before deleting any files.
    -   Prevents the deletion of critical system paths like your home directory (`/home/user`) or the root directory (`/`).
-   **Efficient:** Quickly lists items in the current directory for selection.

## Prerequisites

-   [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/install.html) (version 2.0.8 or higher)
-   [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation)

## Build

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/gabrielcapilla/zrm.git
    cd zrm
    ```

2.  **Build the binary:**
    Use Nimble to build the project. The following command creates an optimized release binary in the current directory.
    ```sh
    nimble build
    ```

## Installation

Install `zrm` using Nimble. This will place the binary in your Nimble bin directory (`~/.nimble/bin`), which should be in your system's `PATH`.

```sh
nimble install
```

## Usage

Simply run `zrm` in any directory:

```sh
zrm
```

This will open an `fzf` window listing all files and subdirectories in the current location.

-   Navigate the list with the arrow keys.
-   Use `<TAB>` to select one or more items.
-   Press `<Enter>` to confirm your selection.
-   Type `y` to confirm the deletion or `n` to cancel.

## Uninstallation

To remove `zrm` from your system, use Nimble:

```sh
nimble uninstall zrm
```
